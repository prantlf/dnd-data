![Will-o'-Wisp](will-o-wisp.png)

## Traits

* **Consume Life.** As a bonus action, the will-o'-wisp can target one creature it can see within 5 feet of it that has 0 hit points and is still alive. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw against this magic or die. If the target dies, the will-o'-wisp regains 10 (3d6) hit points.

* **Ephemeral.** The will-o'-wisp can't wear or carry anything.

* **Incorporeal Movement.** The will-o'-wisp can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

* **Variable Illumination.** The will-o'-wisp sheds bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The will-o'-wisp can alter the radius as a bonus action.

## Actions

* **Shock.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

*Hit:*9 (2d8) lightning damage.

* **Invisibility.** The will-o'-wisp and its light magically become invisible until it attacks or uses its Consume Life, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
