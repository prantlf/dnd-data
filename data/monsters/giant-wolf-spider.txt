# Giant Wolf Spider

![Giant Wolf Spider](giant-wolf-spider.png)

## Traits

* **Spider Climb.** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

* **Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

* **Web Walker.** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

* **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

*Hit:*4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

### Description

Smaller than a giant spider, a giant wolf spider hunts prey across open ground or hides in a burrow or crevice, or in a hidden cavity beneath debris.
