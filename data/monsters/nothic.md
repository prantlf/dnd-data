* **Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:*6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

* **Rotting Gaze.** The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

* **Weird Insight.** The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the nothic’s Wisdom (Insight) check.
