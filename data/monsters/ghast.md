## Traits

* **Stench.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the ghast must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the ghast's Stench for 24 hours.

* **Turning Defiance.** The ghast and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

## Actions

* **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

*Hit:*12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.

* **Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:*10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
