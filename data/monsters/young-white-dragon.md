## Traits

* **Ice Walk.** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.

## Actions

* **Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

* **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

*Hit:*15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.

* **Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:*11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

* **Cold Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
