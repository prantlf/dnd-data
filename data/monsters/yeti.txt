# Yeti

![Yeti](yeti.png)

## Traits

* **Fear of Fire.** If the yeti takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

* **Keen Smell.** The yeti has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

* **Snow Camouflage.** The yeti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.

## Actions

* **Multiattack.** The yeti can use its Chilling Gaze and makes two claw attacks.

* **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:*7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

* **Chilling Gaze.** The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the yeti, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) cold damage and then be paralyzed for 1 minute, unless it is immune to cold damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the targetâ€™s saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Chilling Gaze of all yetis (but not abominable yetis) for 1 hour.

### Description

Yeti are hulking monstrosities that stalk alpine peaks in a ceaseless hunt for food. Their snow-white fur lets them move like ghosts against the frozen landscape.
