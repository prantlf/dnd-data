### Description

Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners. The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.
