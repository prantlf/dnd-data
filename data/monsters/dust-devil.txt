# Dust Devil

![Dust Devil](dust-devil.png)

## Traits

* **Air Form.** The dust devil can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

## Actions

* **Multiattack.** The dust devil makes two slam attacks.

* **Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:*14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

* **Whirlwind (Recharge 4â€“6).** Each creature in the dust devil's space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the dust devil in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.

### Description

Dust devils usually scour the land within 6 miles of a Blue Dragon Lair. A funneling cloud of whirling air with a vague semblance of a face, they can turn themselves into a screaming cyclone, creating a whirlwind that batters creatures even as it flings them away.
