# Diseased Giant Rat

![Diseased Giant Rat](diseased-giant-rat.png)

## Traits

* **Keen Smell.** The rat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

* **Pack Tactics.** The rat has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the rat's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

## Actions

* **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit*: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can’t regain hit points except by magical means, and the target’s hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the target’s hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.

### Description

Some giant rats carry vile diseases that they spread with their bites.
