# Shambling Mound

![Shambling Mound](shambling-mound.png)

## Traits

* **Lightning Absorption.** Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

## Actions

* **Multiattack.** The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 14), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.

* **Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:*13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

* **Engulf.** The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the moundâ€™s turns or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
