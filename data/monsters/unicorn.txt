## Traits

* **Charge.** If the unicorn moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

* **Innate Spellcasting.** The unicorn’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The unicorn can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: detect evil and good, druidcraft, pass without trace

1/day each: calm emotions, dispel evil and good, entangle

* **Magic Resistance.** The unicorn has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### A Unicorn’s Lair

A unicorn’s lair might be an ancient ruin overgrown with vines, a misty clearing surrounded by mighty oaks, a flower-covered hilltop alive with butterflies, or some other serene woodland location.

#### Regional Effects

Transformed by the creature’s celestial presence, the domain of a unicorn might include any of the following magical effects:

- Open flames of a nonmagical nature are extinguished within the unicorn’s domain. Torches and campfires refuse to burn, but closed lanterns are unaffected.
- Creatures native to the unicorn’s domain have an easier time hiding; they have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
- When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the target regains the maximum number of hit points possible for the spell or effect.
- Curses affecting any good-aligned creature are suppressed.

If the unicorn dies, these effects end immediately.
