## Traits

* **Fey Ancestry.** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put the drow to sleep.

* **Innate Spellcasting.** The drow’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: dancing lights

1/day each: darkness, faerie fire

* **Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

* **Shortsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:*5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

* **Hand Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
