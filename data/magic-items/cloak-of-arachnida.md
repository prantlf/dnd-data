![Cloak of Arachnida](cloak-of-arachnida.png)

Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint, silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

* **Poison Resistance.** You have Resistance to Poison damage.

* **Spider Climb.** You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed and can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

* **Spider Walk.** You can’t be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were Difficult Terrain.

* **Web.** You can cast Web (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
