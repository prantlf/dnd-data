# Mithral Armor

![Mithral Armor](mithral-armor.png)

Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes.

If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.
