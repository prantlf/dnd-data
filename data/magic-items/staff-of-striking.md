# Staff of Striking

![Staff of Striking](staff-of-striking.png)

Staff, very rare (requires attunement)

This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 Force damage.

* **Regaining Charges.** The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.

Notes: Bonus: Magic, Damage: Force, Damage, Combat
