# Staff of Fire

![Staff of Fire](staff-of-fire.png)

Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **burning hands** (1 charge), **fireball** (3 charges), or **wall of fire** (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.

Notes: Resistance: Fire, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard, Damage, Control, Combat, Warding
