# Potion of Diminution

Potion, rare

When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the Enlarge/Reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no Concentration required).

The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.

Notes: Control, Utility, Consumable
