Rod, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can cast one of the following spells from it: Heal (expends 1 charge) or Resurrection (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.
