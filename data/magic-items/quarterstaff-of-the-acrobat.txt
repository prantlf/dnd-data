While holding this weapon, you can cause it to emit green Dim Light out to 10 feet, either as a Bonus Action or after you roll Initiative, or you can extinguish the light as a Bonus Action.

While holding this weapon, you can take a Bonus Action to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.

In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties.

** Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole Forms Only).** While holding this weapon, you have Advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

** Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only).** When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a Reaction to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your Armor Class against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You canâ€™t use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

** Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only).** This weapon has the Thrown property with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.


Proficiency with a Quarterstaff allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

This weapon has the following mastery property. To use this property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

** Topple.** If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.
