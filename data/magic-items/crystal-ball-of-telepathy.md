# Crystal Ball of Telepathy

![Crystal Ball of Telepathy](crystal-ball-of-telepathy.png)

Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast Scrying (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also cast Suggestion (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this Suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if Scrying ends. You can’t cast Suggestion in this way again until the next dawn.

Notes: Control, Communication, Scrying, Detection
