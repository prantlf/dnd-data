# Wand of Magic Missiles

![Wand of Magic Missiles](wand-of-magic-missiles.png)

Wand, uncommon

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend no more than 3 charges to cast Magic Missile from it. For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You can increase the spell’s level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.

* **Regaining Charges.** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
