Wondrous Item, very rare

This book contains guidelines for influencing and charming others, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the bookâ€™s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Charisma increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a century.

Notes: Bonus: Charisma Score, Bonus: Ability Score Maximum, Buff
