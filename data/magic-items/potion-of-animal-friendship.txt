# Potion of Animal Friendship

![Potion of Animal Friendship](potion-of-animal-friendship.png)

Potion, uncommon

When you drink this potion, you can cast the level 3 version of the Animal Friendship spell (save DC 13).

Agitating this potionâ€™s muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird feather, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
