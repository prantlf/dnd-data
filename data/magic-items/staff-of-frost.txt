# Staff of Frost

![Staff of Frost](staff-of-frost.png)

Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)

You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **cone of cold** (5 charges), **fog cloud** (1 charge), **ice storm** (4 charges), or **wall of ice** (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
