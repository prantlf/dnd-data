# Potion of Growth

![Potion of Growth](potion-of-growth.png)

Potion, uncommon

When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the Enlarge/Reduce spell for 10 minutes (no Concentration required).

The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.

Notes: Control, Utility, Consumable
