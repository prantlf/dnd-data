# Potion of Speed

![Potion of Speed](potion-of-speed.png)

Potion, very rare

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the Haste spell for 1 minute (no Concentration required) without suffering the wave of lethargy that typically occurs when the effect ends.

This potionâ€™s yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.
