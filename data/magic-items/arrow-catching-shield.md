# Arrow-Catching Shield

![Arrow-Catching Shield](arrow-catching-shield.png)

Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)

You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus is in addition to the Shieldâ€™s normal bonus to AC.

Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.


Shields require the Utilize action to Don or Doff. You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.

Notes: Combat, Warding
