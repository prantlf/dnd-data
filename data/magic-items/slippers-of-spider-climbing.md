Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed. However, the slippers donâ€™t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.

Notes: Set: Innate Speed (Climbing), Movement, Footwear
