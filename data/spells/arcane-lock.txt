You touch a closed door, window, gate, container, or hatch and magically lock it for the duration. This lock canâ€™t be unlocked by any nonmagical means. You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open and close the object despite the lock. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, unlocks it for 1 minute.
