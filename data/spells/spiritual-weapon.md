On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

** Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 2.
