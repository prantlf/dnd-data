You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by Gust of Wind) disperses it.

** Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The fogâ€™s radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
