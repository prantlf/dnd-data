# Heat Metal

*Concentration*1 Minute

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of Heavy or Medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 Fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action on each of your later turns to deal this damage again if the object is within range.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesnâ€™t drop the object, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

** Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.
