Control

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any ongoing spell of level 3 or lower on the target ends. For each ongoing spell of level 4 or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability (DC 10 plus that spell’s level). On a successful check, the spell ends.

** Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You automatically end a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you use.
