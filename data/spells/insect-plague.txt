Damage/Effect

Piercing

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The Sphere remains for the duration, and its area is Lightly Obscured and Difficult Terrain.

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spellâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

** Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.
