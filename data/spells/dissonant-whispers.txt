One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Psychic damage and must immediately use its Reaction, if available, to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

** Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.
