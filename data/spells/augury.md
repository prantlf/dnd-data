Foreknowledge

You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses the omen from the Omens table.

| Omen | For Results That Will Be... |
|---|---|
| Weal | Good |
| Woe | Bad |
| Weal and woe | Good and bad |
| Indifference | Neither good nor bad |

The spell doesnâ€™t account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
