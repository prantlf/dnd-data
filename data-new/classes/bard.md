Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language.

Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.

A Bard’s life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards’ depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

## Bard Class Features

As a Bard, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Bard levels. These features are listed in the Bard Features table.

#### Level 1: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

** Using Bardic Inspiration.** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.

** Number of Uses.** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

** At Higher Levels.** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts.

** Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.

** Spell Slots.** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

** Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

** Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

** Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

** Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

#### Level 2: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 2: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check and lack [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

#### Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Font of Inspiration

You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.

#### Level 7: Countercharm

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

#### Level 10: Magical Secrets

You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you. In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.

#### Level 18: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

#### Level 20: Words of Creation

You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the [Power Word Heal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618880-power-word-heal) and [Power Word Kill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618886-power-word-kill) spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.

## Bard Subclasses

A Bard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels, as specified in the subclass. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to preserve their traditions.

## College of Lore

*Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge*

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

#### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

#### Level 3: Cutting Words

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

#### Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or any combination thereof. A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Bard Features table.

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets these requirements.

#### Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t expended.
