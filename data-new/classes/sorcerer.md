Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.

Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.

Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

## Sorcerer Class Features

As a Sorcerer, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Sorcerer levels. These features are listed in the Sorcerer Features table.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells.

** Cantrips.** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.

** Spell Slots.** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

** Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

** Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

** Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

** Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

#### Level 1: Innate Sorcery

An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

- The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
- You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 2: Font of Magic

You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

** Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points.** You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).

** Creating Spell Slots.** As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.

| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost | Min. Sorcerer Level |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 5 | 5 |
| 4 | 6 | 7 |
| 5 | 7 | 9 |

#### Level 2: Metamagic

Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “Metamagic Options” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

#### Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass

You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration

When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate

If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

#### Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis

While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.

#### Metamagic Options

The following options are available to your Metamagic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order.

##### Careful Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

##### Distant Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell’s range 30 feet.

##### Empowered Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

##### Extended Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

If the affected spell requires [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.

##### Heightened Spell

*Cost: 2 Sorcery Points*

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves against the spell.

##### Quickened Spell

*Cost: 2 Sorcery Points*

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way.

##### Seeking Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

##### Subtle Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.

##### Transmuted Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder.

##### Twinned Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell, such as [Charm Person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618964-charm-person), that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the spell’s effective level by 1.

## Sorcerer Subclasses

A Sorcerer subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels, as specified in the subclass.

## Draconic Sorcery

*Breathe the Magic of Dragons*

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

#### Level 3: Draconic Resilience

The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

#### Level 3: Draconic Spells

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|---|---|
| 3 |
|

[Fear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618872-fear),[Fly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618909-fly)[Arcane Eye](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618863-arcane-eye),[Charm Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618963-charm-monster)[Legend Lore](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619010-legend-lore),[Summon Dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618843-summon-dragon)#### Level 6: Elemental Affinity

Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

You have Resistance to that damage type, and when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

#### Level 14: Dragon Wings

As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). For the duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### Level 18: Dragon Companion

You can cast [Summon Dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618843-summon-dragon) without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.
